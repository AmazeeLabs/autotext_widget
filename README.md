# Autotext widget

A Drupal 8 module that auto-fills entity text fields.

The module is really similar to [Automatic Entity Label](https://www.drupal.org/project/auto_entitylabel). The main difference is that it works as a text field widget, so can be applied to any string fields, not to the label field only.

# Usage

- After module is installed, the "Autotext" widget is available for all "Text (plain)" fields
- The Autotext can use tokens including all entity fields
- The widget is not visible on the entity form.
